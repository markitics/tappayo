Please note the following preferences when helpling me to code.

# 1. Almost never suggest removing comments, except when the comments are specifically related to the edit you're making.

You can do this:
If I had a line
```
// set the name of the player to display later
var name = "Mark" // name of the player
```

then if you delete the line `var name = "Mark" // name of the player` you can also delete the comment immediately preceeding it.

But, that's rare.

Most of the time (99% of the time) you should not suggest deleting comments.

For example, if I ask you to help me "dismiss the numerica keypad", then you should not take the opportunity to make random suggestions like this:

- .background(Color.gray) // or myAccentColor
+ .background(Color.gray)

Similarly do not suggest edits like this
-  Spacer().frame(height: 34) // Maintain space when button is hidden
+  Spacer().frame(height: 34)

If I accept such an edit, I lose the richness of the inline comment, which tells me WHY the line is there, or what alternative input values might be.

# 2. Do not make multiple unrelated edits in one go.
e.g., if I ask you to help me "dismiss the numerica keypad", then you should not take the opportunity to make random suggestions like this:

- .background(Color.gray) // or myAccentColor
+ .background(Color.gray)

# 3. Do not write out lengthy code samples in the composer view - instead, propose direct edits to the relevant file.
